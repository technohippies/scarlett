# Privacy Policy for Scarlett Browser Extension

**Last Updated:** December 19, 2024

## Introduction

Scarlett ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use our browser extension.

## Information We Collect

### Analytics Data
We use Umami Analytics (a privacy-focused analytics service) to collect anonymous usage statistics to help us improve the extension. This includes:

- **Feature Usage Metrics**: Which features you use (chat, study sessions, focus mode, bookmarks, etc.)
- **Performance Data**: How often features are accessed and basic usage patterns
- **Milestone Events**: Anonymous tracking of study streaks and learning progress
- **Technical Information**: Browser type, extension version, and basic system information

### What We DO NOT Collect
- **Personal Conversations**: Your AI chat conversations remain completely local on your device
- **Personal Information**: We do not collect names, email addresses, or other personally identifiable information
- **Browsing History**: We do not track or store your browsing activity outside the extension
- **File Contents**: Any documents or content you process remain on your device
- **Voice Data**: Speech-to-text processing happens locally on your device

## How We Use Information

We use the collected analytics data to:
- Improve extension features and user experience
- Identify and fix bugs or performance issues
- Understand which features are most valuable to users
- Make informed decisions about future development

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Data
- All your personal data (conversations, bookmarks, study progress) is stored locally in your browser
- AI conversations with local models (Jan.ai, Ollama, LM Studio) never leave your device
- Your study materials and progress are synced only within your browser's local storage

### Analytics Data
- Anonymous usage analytics are processed by Umami Analytics
- Data is stored on secure servers and automatically anonymized
- No personal identifiers are transmitted or stored

## Third-Party Services

### Umami Analytics
We use Umami Analytics (umami.is) for privacy-focused website analytics. Umami:
- Does not use cookies or track personal information
- Complies with GDPR and other privacy regulations
- Provides only aggregated, anonymous data
- More information: [Umami Privacy Policy](https://umami.is/privacy)

### Local AI Models
The extension supports integration with local AI services (Jan.ai, Ollama, LM Studio):
- All AI conversations happen locally on your device
- No conversation data is transmitted to external servers
- You maintain complete control over your AI interactions

### ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech (Optional)
If you choose to use ElevenLabs for text-to-speech functionality:
- **Text Data Transmission**: When you use ElevenLabs TTS, the text you want to convert to speech is sent to ElevenLabs' servers
- **User Choice**: This is an optional feature that you can enable/disable in settings
- **API Key Required**: You must provide your own ElevenLabs API key to use this service
- **No Storage by Us**: We do not store or access the text sent to ElevenLabs - it goes directly from your extension to their servers
- **ElevenLabs Privacy**: Your data handling with ElevenLabs is governed by their privacy policy: [ElevenLabs Privacy Policy](https://elevenlabs.io/privacy)
